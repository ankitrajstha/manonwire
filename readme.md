# Man on wire

"The Man on Wire" is a classic game inspired by the vintage "Bug on the Wire." In this game, players control a character, a daring man, who navigates along a series of wires suspended in the air. The objective is to avoid colliding with birds that appear on the wires. The man can move horizontally by switching between wires to the left or right.

**Gameplay:**

- The player starts on one of the wires and moves horizontally to avoid oncoming birds.
- The game provides controls for the player to switch between wires, typically using left and right arrow keys.
- Birds move towards the player's character at varying speeds, creating a dynamic and challenging environment.
- The player must skillfully maneuver the character to avoid collisions with the birds.

**Scoring System:**

- The player's score is based on the number of birds successfully passed during the gameplay.
- Each time the player navigates past a bird without colliding, the score increments.
- The scoring mechanism encourages players to stay on the wires as long as possible, demonstrating their agility and avoiding collisions.
- The longer the player survives and the more birds they pass, the higher the score.

**Game Over:**

- If the man collides with a bird, the game enters a "Game Over" state.
- A dialogue box appears on the screen, informing the player that the game has ended.
- The dialogue box displays the player's final score, showcasing how many birds they successfully passed.
- The player is given an option to restart the game by clicking on a "Restart" button within the dialogue box.

**Restarting the Game:**

- Clicking the "Restart" button resets the game, clearing the current score and obstacles.
- The player's character is placed back on one of the wires, ready to embark on a new attempt.
- The game begins anew, providing players with the opportunity to improve their score and master the art of navigating the wires.

"The Man on Wire" captures the essence of classic games where precision, timing, and quick reflexes are key to achieving a high score. It offers an engaging and nostalgic experience reminiscent of the timeless "Bug on the Wire" while introducing its unique twists and challenges.
